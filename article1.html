          The Ministry of Communication and Informatics (Kominfo) has taken a
          significant step towards ensuring accessibility for the deaf community
          at the XVII Solo Peparnas 2024 by providing Sign Language Interpreter
          (JBI) services at the event's Media Center. This initiative allows
          deaf individuals to stay informed about the happenings of Peparnas
          2024 through press conferences and broadcasts on the Directorate
          General of IKP Kominfo's Youtube channel.<br /><br />

          Ian, one of the 14 JBIs on duty at Peparnas 2024, plays a crucial role
          in interpreting press conferences held at the Media Center. Based at
          the TVRI studio and The Royal Surakarta Heritage, Ian's
          responsibilities extend until the media facilities close at 10 PM each
          day. As a native son of Solo, Ian feels a sense of pride and
          fulfillment in contributing to the success of this national event.
          Prior to his duties at Peparnas XVII, Ian underwent thorough
          preparation, including researching sports-specific terminology that
          would be used during press conferences. He expressed gratitude for the
          opportunity to participate in this national event and return to his
          hometown. Ian's professional experience includes working as a JBI at
          the Constitutional Court, Palembang Police, and Palembang TVRI.<br /><br />

          Interpreting sign language at the Peparnas XVII Media Center presented
          unique challenges for Ian, who had to adapt to the camera positioning,
          lighting, and other settings to ensure clear communication. The Media
          Center, provided by the Ministry of Communication and Information,
          serves as a vital platform for journalists to disseminate information
          and news related to the Peparnas XVII Solo activities, which took
          place from October 6 to 13, 2024.<br /><br />
