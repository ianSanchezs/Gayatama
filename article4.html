          International Sign Language Day, commemorated on September 23, serves
          as a recognition of the vibrant and diverse world of sign languages
          used by the global deaf community. According to the World Federation
          of the Deaf, the number of deaf people worldwide has surpassed 70
          million, each utilizing one of over 300 distinct sign languages.
          <br /><br />

          Sign languages, while structurally different from spoken languages,
          are complete natural languages in their own right. In Indonesia, deaf
          individuals employ two primary sign languages: the Indonesian Sign
          Language System (SIBI) and Indonesian Sign Language (Bisindo). SIBI,
          officially recognized by the Indonesian government, serves as the
          instructional language in Special Needs Schools (SLB) for deaf
          children. It aims to visually represent the grammatical structure of
          Indonesian spoken language. On the other hand, Bisindo emerged
          organically within Indonesian culture and is widely used by the deaf
          community in daily life. It was developed by a group of deaf
          individuals based on their observations and experiences.
          <br /><br />

          As emphasized by Kustinah, a teacher at Tulungagung Special Needs
          School, learning sign language can be facilitated through the use of
          songs. She suggests starting with recognizing the alphabet and then
          progressing to identifying objects and family members. This approach
          can make the learning process more engaging and effective.
          <br /><br />

          Beyond its significance as a means of communication, International
          Sign Language Day also serves as a reminder of the importance of
          hearing health. Dr. M. Mundir Arif, an ENT specialist at dr. Iskak
          Hospital, urges everyone to prioritize hearing care. He highlights the
          potential consequences of hearing loss and underscores the crucial
          role of sign language in enabling effective communication and learning
          for those who are deaf.<br /><br />
