          International Sign Languages Day, celebrated annually on September
          23rd, serves as a crucial opportunity to acknowledge and support the
          unique linguistic identities and cultural richness of deaf and
          hard-of-hearing individuals. According to the World Federation of the
          Deaf (WFD), over 70 million people worldwide experience deafness, with
          80% residing in developing countries. This diverse population utilizes
          a staggering 300 distinct sign languages for communication.<br /><br />

          The United Nations recognizes sign languages as fully developed
          natural languages, with structures independent of spoken languages. To
          emphasize the importance of sign languages in ensuring the human
          rights of deaf individuals, the UN General Assembly proclaimed
          September 23rd as International Sign Languages Day. This resolution
          specifically highlights the need for early access to quality sign
          language services, including education.<br /><br />

          Looking at the history of this important day, International Sign
          Languages Day was established by the WFD, an organization representing
          approximately 70 million deaf people globally. The resolution for its
          official recognition, A/RES/72/161, was championed by Antigua and
          Barbuda's Permanent Mission to the United Nations and garnered support
          from 97 member states, leading to its unanimous adoption on December
          19th, 2017.<br /><br />

          The selection of September 23rd as International Sign Languages Day
          coincides with the founding date of the WFD in 1951. This date
          symbolizes the birth of a significant advocacy organization dedicated
          to preserving sign languages and deaf culture. These elements are
          recognized as fundamental prerequisites for securing deaf people's
          human rights.<br /><br />

          The first official celebration of International Sign Languages Day
          took place in 2018, integrated within the broader framework of
          International Week of the Deaf. Notably, International Deaf Week was
          first observed in September 1958 and has since evolved into a global
          movement promoting deaf unity and raising awareness about challenges
          faced by deaf individuals in their daily lives.<br /><br />

          The 2024 celebration of International Sign Languages Day calls for the
          international community to come together under the unifying banner of
          sign language. World leaders and officials are encouraged to endorse
          the theme "Sign Up for Sign Language Rights." The global community
          strives towards upholding the linguistic human rights of deaf people,
          working alongside the implementation of the Rights of Persons with
          Disabilities convention, adopted in December 2006. In line with the
          spirit of inclusivity, blue remains the primary color for the 2024
          celebration of International Sign Languages Day. This vibrant blue
          reaffirms a shared commitment to empowering national sign languages
          and expressing solidarity with the global deaf community.<br /><br />
